# i2c_sensors
This is ROS code to read data from TeraRanger Duo Sensors via I2C. It should also work with TeraRanger One when no uSonic Sensors are provided. Tested to compile on my computer and a Raspberry Pi (it is actually configured for that).
More details can be found in the parameter .yaml file.
Thanks to Simon Sander for writing the code for the uSonic sensors that I modified for this.
